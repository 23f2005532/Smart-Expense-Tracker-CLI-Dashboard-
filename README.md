# Smart Expense Tracker (Web + CLI)

The **Smart Expense Tracker** is a full-stack personal finance management app designed to help users easily track and analyze their daily expenses — from anywhere.  
It comes with a modern **Web Dashboard** for managing expenses visually and a powerful **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for advanced and admin operations.


---

## Project Overview

This app is a combination of:
- **Web App** – for everyday users to log and visualize their expenses  
- **CLI Tool** – for admin tasks like data cleanup, backups, and generating reports  
- **Smart Analytics** – for trend detection and auto-categorization using Machine Learning

Everything runs on a **common database**, so actions from the web or CLI stay in sync.

## Features

### User-Facing Web Application
- Create an account, log in, and manage your expenses  
- Add, edit, or delete transactions with notes and categories  
- View spending summaries by category, month, and time range  
- Interactive visualizations (Chart.js) for better insights  
- Export data to CSV/Excel for offline analysis  

### CLI Admin Tool
- Add or view expenses right from your terminal  
- Generate quick reports or statistics  
- Backup and clean database with one command  
- Train ML model for auto-tagging expenses (optional)  
- Perform admin operations securely  

### Smart Insights 
- Expense categorization based on note text using NLP  
- Monthly trend prediction and spending alerts

## Learning Goals

This project helps me:
- Strengthen my **backend development** skills (Flask, REST APIs)
- Practice **database management** and ORM design  
- Build **clean CLI tools** for backend/admin workflows  
- Understand **data visualization** and interactive dashboards  
- Experiment with **basic ML features** like text classification
